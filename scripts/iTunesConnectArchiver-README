About
=====

iTunesConnectArchiver is a python application for automatically retrieving and reporting sales data from Apple's iTunes Connect website. Although fully functional on it's own, it is intended more as a starting point from which one can build their own reporting tools.

iTunesConnectArchiver is based on original work by Kirby Tuner, AppDailySales: http://code.google.com/p/appdailysales/ and  the wonderful Beautiful Soup library: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

Requirements
============

python 2.6 or later, with support for sqlite3 module  
Beautiful Soup (included)  

Usage
=====

iTunesConnectArchiver revolves around the idea of a sales database. The sales database (an SQLite 3 database) stores a parsed representation of the data avaliable on iTunes Connect. Running the *update* command will create a new database, or update an existing database with whatever new data is avaliable on the site:

Creating or updating a sales database:
--------------------------------------
    iTunesConnectArchiver --username=MyAppleID --password=MyAppleIDPassword --database=/path/to/data.sqlite update

Each time update is run, it collects -all- avaliable data from iTunes Connect (typically the past 7 days) and merges it into the database. This smooths out problems with missing days, if web servers are down for a day or two, the script will happily merge in the data the next time it successfully runs. 

Furthermore, iTunesConnectArchiver will *attempt* to convert all currency units to US Dollars. It does this based on the exchange rate for the day of the sale. Note that this is -different- from Apple's accounting, where the exchange rate is done on the day the payment to the developer is made. Thus, do *not* use iTunesConnectArchiver for accounting purposes, it is for guidence only.

Once data has been collected, iTunesConnectArchiver can be used to print out a pretty ASCII graph of the stats and sales with the *report* command:

Viewing a report from a sales database:
--------------------------------------
    iTunesConnectArchiver -d /path/to/data.sqlite report

This will produce pretty ASCII charts'n'graphs. Overall sales states only include products that have a non-zero price. Charts will be emitted for free products, representing their download count.
